the shit setting is easily explained

pandas, bunnies, world shroom, wooden swords

why? because it's a web-rpg. w-crpg

skills: 
str
spd

the overworld contains the fighting, but you can enter locations sideways

health bars can go beyond to show the power of a player

there's an action bar with skills like heal, fire ball, potions

what is persistent:
your character can get powerful


players float freely over the world
    pros: very dumb which fits the theme
    pros: real-time
    --
    cons: map will need a lot of detail
alternative: players use movement points
    cons: very crpgish
