joke rewrite
it is a dark age of magic with cultural decline
the king has ordered its court to research necromancy while also banning magic and promoting paganism
only its paladins, healers and temples are allowed to cast spells
commoners are exiled when protesting
books on magic are burned as grimoires
holds across the country who rely on magic to defend borders turn into factions
the lands are thrown into civil war
wise wizards convene about the state of the world and decree that magic should be free and call for peace
at their insistence the king stands down and becomes a commoner clad in rags
what is unknown is that he is already been corrupted by dark rituals
magic is no longer outlawed but with its poor sources remained for the devout
without a king a cold war begins with factions clashing in politics and secretive research
orcs use the chaos to launch skirmishes against the weakened kingdom
to protect the kingdom druids use the world shroom to summon treants
one day one of the wizards realizes his lapse in logic and foresees a dark evil
so he creates a fellowship to go after the king
