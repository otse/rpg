narn is divided into three holds
which again are factions

the norse nobles which are native nobles under the banner of unison and aristocracy
the norns which are ascended nobles who are corrupted by fondu fountains
the mancers who are freaks and are encroaching on the land but keep cursed critters like talking sheep off the land
