> it is a dark age of magic and cultural decline
> the empire bans magic from being practised save for its paladins, its temples and its healers
> what seems like a righteous law is a coverup to keep the people pagan
> most books on magic are taken from libaries and labeled grimoires
> corrupt nobles working for the king experiment in secrecy with necromancy in old dungeons and ruined temples 
> counties protest the new laws and become separate factions and before long a great civil war engulfs the lands
> wizards of the age gather to convene about the state of the humans and decree that magic is not ruinous per se and call for peace
> at their insistence the king stands down who becomes a commoner clothed in rags
> however what is unknown is that he is become consumed by a dark corruption
> [the king is the dark wanderer]
> magic is no longer forbidden but with its poor sources remains obscure
> a new war begins with the orcs who skirmish against the weakened empire
> in desparation druids turn to the world tree to summon guardians of the wild called treants
