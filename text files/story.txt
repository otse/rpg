the year is some medieval fantasy year

the world is in shambles
it is a dark age of magic
the empire has banned magic save from devout colleges and select temples
exiles take to distant lands and join covens
kings and nobles cower in strongholds
a division befalls the lands as holds become factions
a civil war ensues for the soul of the land
wise wizards hold council to convene about a dark prophesy
a gathering of druids call on the world tree, making sentries of nature called treants
nomads have made spawns from old antlion nests using a dark ritual
