> it is a dark age of magic and cultural decline
> the empire bans magic from being practised save for its paladins, its temples and its healers
> what seems like a righteous law is a coverup to keep the people pagan
> most books on magic are taken from libaries and labeled grimoires
> corrupt nobles working for the king experiment in secrecy with necromancy in old dungeons and ruined temples 
> counties who rely on the old ways to defend their borders with might but also magic are against the new ruling
> holds become factions and a civil war ensues
> wise wizards gather to convene about the state of the humans and decree that magic is not ruinous of itself and call for the fighting to stop
> the king is asked to stand down and he becomes a commoner clothed in rags
> however what is unknown is that he is already become defiled
> [the king is the dark wanderer]
> magic is no longer forbidden but having poor sources remains obscure
> war begins with the orcs who skirmish against the weakened empire
> druids calls on the world tree to make sentries of nature called treants
