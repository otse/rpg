thinking of using mrmotarius rotating swamp (img/3wGFpM) as a base for the game

so besides looking at the world map and feeling involved in the world and setting, the game will use a simple classic aesthethic with a reduced color palette reminiscent of ms paint

the game will still be a web rpg for all intents and purposes
